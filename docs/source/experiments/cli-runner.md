# The CLI experiment runner

The `experimaestro.experiments` module factorizes the boilerplate of launching
an experiment: your code provides a `run(helper, cfg)` entry point, and the
experimental parameters come from `YAML` configuration files.

The experiment is then started with

```sh
experimaestro run-experiment full.yaml
```

See the [CLI documentation](../cli.md#running-experiments) for all the options,
and {py:class}`~experimaestro.experiments.cli.ExperimentHelper` for the helper
passed to `run`. This mechanism can be extended to support more specific helpers
(see e.g. experimaestro-ir).

## The entry point

The configuration class must derive from
{py:class}`~experimaestro.experiments.ConfigurationBase`:

```python
# experiment.py
from experimaestro.experiments import ExperimentHelper, configuration, ConfigurationBase

@configuration
class Configuration(ConfigurationBase):
    #: Default learning rate
    learning_rate: float = 1e-3

def run(helper: ExperimentHelper, cfg: Configuration):
    # Experimental code
    ...
```

with `full.yaml` located in the same folder:

```yaml
id: my-experiment
file: experiment
learning_rate: 1e-4
```

### Using a module

The entry point can also be a module, in which case the Python path can be set
by the configuration file:

```yaml
# Module name containing the "run" function
module: first_stage.experiment

# Python paths relative to the directory containing this YAML file.
# By default, the python path assumes that the YAML file is in the same folder
# as the loaded module: for `first_stage.experiment` it is set to `..`, and for
# `first_stage.sub.experiment` to `../..`.
pythonpath:
    - ..
```

## YAML reference

The options below come from
{py:class}`~experimaestro.experiments.ConfigurationBase`; any other key is
passed to your own configuration class.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | string | **required** | Unique identifier for the experiment |
| `file` | string | `"experiment"` | Relative path to the Python file containing the `run` function |
| `module` | string | `None` | Python module containing the `run` function (mutually exclusive with `file`) |
| `pythonpath` | list | `None` | List of paths to add to Python path (relative to YAML file directory) |
| `imports` | list | `None` | List of YAML file paths to import and merge (current file takes priority) |
| `parent` | string | `None` | *(Deprecated, use `imports`)* Relative path to a parent YAML file to inherit from |
| `pre_experiment` | string | `None` | Python file path or module name to execute before importing the experiment |
| `title` | string | `""` | Short description of the experiment |
| `subtitle` | string | `""` | Additional details about the experiment |
| `description` | string | `""` | Full description of the experiment |
| `paper` | string | `""` | Source paper reference for this experiment |
| `add_timestamp` | bool | `False` | Append timestamp (`YYYYMMDD-HHMM`) to experiment ID |
| `dirty_git` | string | `"warn"` | Action when git has uncommitted changes: `ignore`, `warn`, or `error` |

## Composing configurations

Configurations are merged from several sources. In increasing order of
priority: the files listed in `imports`, the `--pre-yaml` files, the main file,
the `--post-yaml` files, and the `-c` overrides.

```yaml
# experiment.yaml — imported files are merged in order
imports:
  - base.yaml
  - optimizer.yaml
id: my-experiment
learning_rate: 1e-4  # Overrides the value from base.yaml
```

```bash
# Additional files on the command line
experimaestro run-experiment --pre-yaml defaults.yaml --post-yaml overrides.yaml main.yaml

# Individual values, using the OmegaConf dotlist syntax: plain values,
# nested values, and list items by index
experimaestro run-experiment -c learning_rate=1e-5 -c model.hidden_size=512 \
    -c data.transforms.0.name=resize experiment.yaml
```

Use `--show` to print the merged configuration as JSON instead of running the
experiment — the quickest way to debug an inheritance or override problem:

```bash
experimaestro run-experiment --show -c learning_rate=1e-5 --pre-yaml base.yaml experiment.yaml
```

## Pre-experiment setup

`pre_experiment` runs Python code **before** the experiment module is imported,
either from a file path (`pre_experiment.py`) or from a module name
(`mypackage.pre_experiment`, useful when the setup is shared by several
experiments). Use it to set environment variables, configure logging, or mock
heavy modules.

Mocking is worth a special mention: with
{py:func}`~experimaestro.experiments.mock_modules`, imports of the given
modules return fake objects during the configuration phase, which is much
faster for code bases importing PyTorch and friends. The jobs themselves are
executed in their own process and use the real modules.

```python
# pre_experiment.py
import os
from experimaestro.experiments import mock_modules

os.environ["OMP_NUM_THREADS"] = "4"

# Submodules are automatically included
mock_modules(['torch', 'pytorch_lightning', 'transformers', 'huggingface_hub'])
```

```yaml
id: my-experiment
pre_experiment: pre_experiment.py
file: experiment
```

Mocked objects accept attribute access, calls and instantiation; they work as
decorators (`@torch.compile`, `@torch.no_grad()`), as base classes
(`torch.nn.Module`), and support subscript notation (`Tensor[int]`).

## Dirty git check

Experimaestro can check whether your project's git repository has uncommitted
changes when an experiment starts, so that a result can always be traced back
to a commit:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ignore` | Don't check or warn about uncommitted changes |
| `warn` | Log a warning if there are uncommitted changes (default) |
| `error` | Raise a {py:class}`~experimaestro.DirtyGitError` and abort the experiment |

```yaml
id: my-experiment
dirty_git: error  # Fail if git is dirty
```

The same check is available from the Python API, and raises
{py:class}`~experimaestro.DirtyGitError` when set to `error`:

```python
from experimaestro import experiment, DirtyGitAction, DirtyGitError

try:
    with experiment(workdir, "my-experiment", dirty_git=DirtyGitAction.ERROR) as xp:
        ...
except DirtyGitError as e:
    print(f"Cannot run experiment: {e}")
```
